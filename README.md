You will need access to Matlab and Simulink for this interview. If you don't already have a copy of Matlab downloaded and ready to use, please go to www.mathworks.com, create a Mathworks account, and request a free trial. You should then be able to download a copy of Matlab and Simulink to use for free for 30 days. 

If you don't have the disk space on your computer to download it, you can also use Matlab online (matlab.mathworks.com). If you choose this option, please be familiar with how to import files into Matlab online.

If for some reason you aren't able to get a free trial of Matlab, you can install the free open source alternative: Octave (https://octave.org/download).
